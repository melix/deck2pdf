`deck2pdf` is a simple application that will convert your http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/[deck.js],
 http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js[reveal.js], http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js[impress.js],
 http://flowtime-js.marcolago.com/[Flowtime.js]
  or https://github.com/paulrouget/dzslides[DZSlides] slide deck into a PDF file. Deck2PDF is also capable
  of handling other HTML5 libraries as long as you feed it <<CustomProfiles,with a profile>>.

This application relies on a JavaFX application, so you need at least a Java 7 installation that bundles JavaFX (which should be the case for all newer installs of Java).

== Install

image::https://travis-ci.org/melix/deck2pdf.png?branch=master[Build Status, link="https://travis-ci.org/melix/deck2pdf"]

----
./gradlew distZip
----

Will generate a distribution into `build/distributions/` that you can unzip wherever you want.

== Usage

----
deck2pdf --profile=deckjs <inputfile> <outputfile>
----

By default, deck2pdf assumes that you are using deck.js, but there more profiles supported:

* deckjs, for http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/[deck.js]
* revealjs, for http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js[reveal.js]
* impressjs, for http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js[impress.js]
* dzslides, for https://github.com/paulrouget/dzslides[DZSlides]
* flowtimejs, for http://flowtime-js.marcolago.com/[Flowtime.js]

For example, to convert a Deck.js slidedeck into PDF:

----
deck2pdf slides.html slides.pdf
----

Or for a reveal.js slidedeck:

----
deck2pdf --profile=revealjs slides.html slides.pdf
----

Optionally, you can specify width and height:

----
deck2pdf --width=1024 --height=768 slides.html slides.pdf
----

[[CustomProfiles]]
== Support for other HTML5 slideshows

`deck2pdf` is capable of handling many HTML5 slideshows. The current distribution supports several profiles out of the
box but it is easy to add yours. Depending on the complexity of the the framework, you can use either a simple
properties file to describe your framework or a more complex Groovy file. Both profile types rely on the fact that
you communicate with the browser with Javascript. This means that `deck2js` should be compatible with any HTML5
slideshow that exposes a Javascript API.

=== Simple profile using properties

The easiest way to define a new profile is to create a properties file. For example, here is the file that the
`deck.js` export uses:

----
include::src/main/resources/deckjs.properties[]
----

The properties files consists of two entries:

* `totalSlides` is a Javascript snippet which will compute the total number of slides of the deck
* `nextSlide` is the Javascript code which needs to be called to jump to the next slide

Properties files are very simple, so are only capable of handling decks for which the number of slides is known in
advance and the command to jump from one slide to another is always the same. For more complex slide shows, you can
use the http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy] profiles.

=== Advanced profiles
==== Example
Advanced profiles are written using the http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy] scripting language. However, they are pretty
simple too and they expose a simple API that should fit most situations.

Here is an example of profile as it is defined for `impress.js`:

[source,groovy]
----
include::src/main/resources/impressjs.groovy[]
----

The file name for a properties profile *must* end with `.properties`.

==== Groovy API

The http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy] allows you to define more complex interactions with the slide deck. It also allows
you to export slide decks for which you don't know the number of slides in advance, as long as you are capable of telling
that you've reached the end of the slide deck.

Calling javascript in the browser from the profile is done using the `js` function:

[source,groovy]
----
js 'var slideCount = slides.length;'
----

Then the http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy] profile exposes some hooks that you can use:

* `setup` is called once the slide deck is loaded and ready for export. It gives you a chance to perform an initial
customization before exporting the slides. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
setup = {
    // disable controls for better rendering
    js 'Reveal.configure({controls: false, progress: false});'
}
----

* `isLastSlide` is called after a slide has been exported. If the method returns true, then export is complete. For
example:

[source,groovy]
----
isLastSlide = {
    js '''
        var totalSlides = Dz.slides.length;
        var cSlide = Dz.idx;
        cSlide==totalSlides && Dz.step==Dz.slides[cSlide - 1].$$('.incremental > *').length
    '''
}
----

* `totalSlides` can be used to determine the total number of slides (if a slide contains a transition, each transition
is counted as a slide). It is optional, as long as you define the `isLastSlide` hook. Providing it would add a counter
to the log output.

[source,groovy]
----
totalSlides = {
    js (/$$(".step", byId('impress')).length/)
}
----

* `nextSlide` must be implemented so that `deck2pdf` knows how to jump from one slide to another (or one transition
to another). For example:

[source,groovy]
----
nextSlide = {
    js('api.next()')
}
----

As the Groovy profile is stateful, you can for example keep track of the slide number and have a distinct operation
depending on the slide number:

[source,groovy]
----
int curSlide = 0
nextSlide = {
    curSlide++
    switch (curSlide) {
        case 1:
            js 'api.next()'
            break;
        case 2:
            js 'api.goto(2)'
            break;
        default:
            js "api.goto($curSlide)"
    }
}
----

* `pause` lets you change the duration before next slide is exported, in milliseconds. Currently, you are not allowed
to set a distinct pause for each slide, the change is global. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
pause = 2000
----

The file name for a Groovy profile *must* end with `.groovy`.

=== Using a custom profile

Once you've written a new profile, you can use it with the `--profile` switch:

----
deck2pdf --profile=/path/to/profile.groovy slides.html slides.pdf
----

Of course, you can submit a pull request so that we include your profile into the distribution!

== Custom fonts

You'll need to read this section if you have custom fonts in your presenation.

=== JavaFX 3.0: CSS3 @font-face

In order to use custom fonts in your presentation, as defined using the CSS3 +@font-face@, you need to use at least JavaFX 3.0 (available in JDK 8). Otherwise, the embedded browser will fall back to using the default system font. 

Here's an example custom font sourced from http://www.google.com/fonts[Google Fonts]:

[source,html]
----
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Yanone+Kaffeesatz:400,700">
----

This link element imports the following CSS:

[source,css]
----
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Yanone Kaffeesatz Regular'), local('YanoneKaffeesatz-Regular'), url(http://themes.googleusercontent.com/static/fonts/yanonekaffeesatz/v4/YDAoLskQQ5MOAgvHUQCcLbvy90DtE_Pg_qiF9bHvTzw.ttf) format('truetype');
}
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 700;
  src: local('Yanone Kaffeesatz Bold'), local('YanoneKaffeesatz-Bold'), url(http://themes.googleusercontent.com/static/fonts/yanonekaffeesatz/v4/We_iSDqttE3etzfdfhuPRUgbSk09ekaEjkXjfj0Ujx8.ttf) format('truetype');
}
----

You can now use these two combinations of +font-family+, +font-style+ and +font-weight+ in your presentation. Unlike a normal browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc), you cannot use a font combination that is not represented here (or on your system). If you attempt to use a combination not represented here (such as a combination that include `font-style: italic;`), the embedded browser will fall back to using the default font.

Aside from that exception, custom fonts should just work when using JavaFX 3.0.

=== JavaFX 2.2: Explicit font loading

If you you're using JavaFX 2.2 (available in JDK 7), you can still use custom fonts, but you must load them explicitly before the embedded browser loads the presentation.

First, download the TTF file for each font you want to use and copy it to +src/main/resources+. The files should be named using the hyphenated form shown in the CSS above. For example:

* YanoneKaffeesatz-Regular.ttf
* YanoneKaffeesatz-Bold.ttf

Next, open the +Browser.java+ source file and add the following declarations at the top of the constructor. These declarations load the fonts from the classpath:

[source,java]
----
Font.loadFont(getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("YanoneKaffeesatz-Regular.ttf"), -1);
Font.loadFont(getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("YanoneKaffeesatz-Bold.ttf"), -1);
----

Don't forget to add the following import to the +Browser.java+ source file:

[source,java]
----
import javafx.scene.text.Font;
----

Finally, build the deck2pdf distribution. You'll now be able to use the YanoneKaffeesatz font in your presentation when using JavaFX 2.2.
